# Rock Paper Scissors Terminal Game #

This is a indie game for a terminal. Feel free to add code or change things, but this is so simple and the AI not is really an AI, is a random number selector.


Necesary things: Python 3.10+ and a terminal or a code editor with a terminal.

PDTA: I made it in only ten minutes to kill time, so please be comprensive and don't comment hate and similar things.
